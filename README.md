This is a Python package that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program maintains a full, identical
copy of source folder at replica folder.

To implement it you should be in the main folder and write into console command 
“python main.py “sourcedir” “targetdir” interval “log_file_path” “.

For the whole documentation please open 'docs.pdf' or write python main.py --help to see the help command.
